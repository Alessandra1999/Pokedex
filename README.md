# Pokedex

This is a Pokédex project made using HTML, CSS and JS in which you can search and view the Pokédex in an intuitive way.

## Improvements

The project was made by [Alessandra](https://github.com/Alessandra1999), below are some of the improvements made by me, [Carlos](https://github.com/carlooosdev), these are in a Pull Request that I made on the project.

- CSS improvement, the project was actually quite beautiful, but the positions were strange, very messed up.
- Hovers improvement. I also edited the button hover in the CSS, and I think personally, it looked much better.
- I improved the search system, in the original project, to search for a pokemon I had to write its full name and if there was a wrong letter it wouldn't find it. Now, if you only put part of the name, for example: char instead of charmander, it will find it.

## Overview

Anyway, I made some changes, if you want to contribute to the project, go to [Alessandra's GitHub](https://github.com/Alessandra1999/Pokedex) and make a Pull Request.
